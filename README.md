Araknid
=======

A compact, versatile MVC engine for PHP.


Why ?
-----

Well, i used to develop with CodeIgniter for years now and i want to go 
further. I need a small footprinted MVC engine with module support but 
without too many standard features.

Araknid purpose is to create a very small set of core object oriented 
libraries with some helpers to speedup development.
