Araknid
=======

A compact, versatile MVC engine for PHP.


Why ?
-----

Well, i used to develop with CodeIgniter for years now and i want to go
further. I need a small footprinted MVC engine with module support but
without too many standard features.

Araknid purpose is to create a very small set of core object oriented
libraries with some helpers to speedup development.

Prerequisites
-------------
  - PHP 5.2
  - A webserver (works fine with Apache & Cherokee)

Installation
------------

Araknid is able to handle multiple applications with only one set of
libraries.

Start cloning araknid repo :
  git clone git://github.com/aegypius/araknid.git my-araknid-projects

You can pull the sample application like this :
  cd my-araknid-projects
  git submodule update --init

The document root of this sample application is in apps/sample/public.
Configure your web server with this directory

You should see a beautiful hello world.
